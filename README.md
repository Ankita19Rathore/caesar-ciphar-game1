# Caesar Cipher Game

This is a Python-based implementation of the classic **Caesar Cipher** encryption technique. The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a fixed shift key, demonstrating basic cryptography concepts and string manipulation in Python.

## 🔐 About Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

## ✨ Features

- Encrypt messages using a user-defined shift key  
- Decrypt messages using the same key  
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters  
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters such as numbers, spaces, and symbols

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository  
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py

  Enter the message.

  Enter the shift key (a number).

  The script will display the encrypted or decrypted message.
